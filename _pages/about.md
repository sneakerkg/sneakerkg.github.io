About Me
======
* I am an Applied Scientist Manager at [Amazon Web Service](https://aws.amazon.com/) Shanghai AI Lab (ASAIL), leading computer vision efforts. I play a lot with objects. In this period, I will be focusing on object-centric learning, visual-language model, graph neural network and causal representation learning, exploring and exploiting their usage in applications like video analysis, 3D vision, autonomous driving and robotics.
* Before joining Amazon, I was a Staff Machine Learning Scientist at [Tesla Autopilot](https://www.tesla.com/autopilot) AI/Vision team, working with Dr. [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/). I was one of the major contributors of the Autopilot vision neural network stack and the task owner of Autopilot (Dynamic and Static) Object Detection during 2017 - 2020. My working items have been shipped into hundreds of thousands of Tesla cars worldwide during major Autopilot releases, contributing to Autopilot functionalities like Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, Auto Lane Change, [Automatic Emergency Braking](https://www.tesla.com/blog/model-3-earns-5-star-safety-rating-euro-ncap), [Navigation on Autopilot](https://www.tesla.com/blog/introducing-navigate-autopilot), [Smart Summon](https://electrek.co/2019/09/24/tesla-smart-summon-driverless-video/), etc.
* Prior to Tesla, I spent 3.25 years at Microsoft. I was a Software Engineer 2 at Microsoft [Bing](https://cn.bing.com/images/trending?form=Z9LH) Multimedia team (now under Microsoft AI & Research Org) working with Dr. [Linjun Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cvgKxDQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), where I was working on Image-Text Semantic Embedding to contribute to functionalities like Image Annotation and Image Search in Bing Search Engine. And during my graduate years, I interned at Microsoft Research Asia, advised by Prof. [Zheng Zhang](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/zheng-zhang) and Dr. [Kuiyuan Yang](https://sites.google.com/site/kuiyuanyang/), where I was working on both training platform and vision applications of deep learning. I was a major contributor of the open-source deep learning training framework [Minerva](https://github.com/dmlc/minerva) and also contributed to the machine learning library [MXNet](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet).
* I received M.S degree in Computer Science from [Wangxuan Institute Of Computer Technology](http://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/index.htm), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Yuxin Peng](http://59.108.48.34/tiki/yuxinpeng/). And B.S degree in Computer Science from [Nankai University](https://www.nankai.edu.cn/).
* My enthusiasm is to apply machine learning to large-scale, life-changing technologies, currently with a focus on computer vision related applications.
