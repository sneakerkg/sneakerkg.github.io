## Abstract
The description relates to diversified hybrid image annotation for annotating images. One implementation includes generating first image annotations for a query image using a retrieval-based image annotation technique. Second image annotations can be generated for the query image using a model-based image annotation technique. The first and second image annotations can be integrated to generate a diversified hybrid image annotation result for the query image.
